#It is called a hello world program of machine learning and it’s a classification problem where we will predict the flower class based on its petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. Machine learning is almost everywhere nowadays. It’s become more and more necessary day by day. From the recommendation of what to buy to recognizing a person, robotics, everywhere is machine learning. So in this project, we’ll create the “Hello World” of machine learning which means Iris flower classification.

Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
